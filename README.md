# Project Name

Road Trip Photo Gallery.

## Description

This is one of my projects using React, was a fun experience learning about how it works and just how much different it is compared to jQuery. This is just a simply photo gallery it isn't much but it was the start of the road down the React path.

## installation

Everything should be all set, all you have to do is run npm install. Then when you want to use the application.
Run npm run server and npm run client in your terminal.

## Usage

This is just a simply photo gallery application and the ability to like photos like a mini Facebook or Instagram. Eventually I'm planning on adding the ability to add new photo's thru inputs with delete functionality. Plus some extra styling and features.

## Built With

React
Axios
PG
Express
SweetAlert

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to my teachers and fellow students at EDA with the help to understand React.
